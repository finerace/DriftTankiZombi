A? What?;
Ahh... It's you. New tanker, right?;
Hey Ya! I'm John. They also call it Crazy;
No one has visited me for a long time! It's boring here...;
I'm not as popular as my brother Dave... Oh well;
You came to learn how to fight zombie people, right?;
It's actually quite simple, if you don't... uh... never mind;
You just crush them or open fire in their direction from all the guns;
In fact, it is much more difficult to find fuel for a tank!;
Without fuel, your tank is useless, and the zombies will simply tear you apart;
Fuel is scattered throughout the city, in different nooks and crannies;
In general, the main goal is to get to the next level as quickly as possible;
To begin with, try to at least get out of here, travel back and forth;
Get familiar with the controls, press randomly different buttons;
And you can easily figure out whatâ€™s going on here and get out of here;
I'm waiting for you at the next level, good luck!;
Hr..Huh? WHAT?;
Ah, you again. You did it!;
Incredible!;
Hmm... Oh well;
It was quite simple, wasn't it?;
But as you move further and further, the levels will become more difficult;
And it will no longer be possible to drive back and forth by accident;
The best tactic is to simply memorize the level;
Which road leads where, all the nooks and turns;
And you will find a way out much faster;
I also advise you to go to my Army Shop;
I sell upgrades for tanks there;
You can also buy new tanks there, cooler ones;
It's in the Main Menu, if anything. The rest you can figure out on your own. See you!;
