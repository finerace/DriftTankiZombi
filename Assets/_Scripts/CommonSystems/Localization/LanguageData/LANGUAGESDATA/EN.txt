A? What?;
Aah... It's you. A new tanker, right?;
Hello! I'm John. They also call the Insane;
No one has visited me for a long time! It's boring here...;
I'm not as popular as my brother Dave... Oh well;
You came here to learn how to fight zombie people, right?;
It's actually pretty simple, unless you're... uh... it does not matter;
Just crush them or open fire in their direction with all the guns;
In fact, it is much more difficult to find fuel for a tank!;
Without fuel, your tank is useless, and the zombies will just tear you apart;
Fuel is scattered all over the city, in different corners;
In general, the main goal is to get to the next level as soon as possible;
To begin with, try to get out at least from here, travel back and forth;
Get used to the controls, press different buttons randomly;
And you can easily figure out what's going on here and get out of here.;
I'm waiting for you at the next level, good luck!;
Hr.. AND? WHAT?;
Ah, you again. You did it!;
Unbelievable!;
Yeah... Okay;
It was pretty simple, wasn't it?;
But as you progress further and further, the levels will be more difficult;
And it won't happen by chance to go back and forth anymore;
The best tactic is to just memorize the level;
Which road leads where, all the nooks and turns;
And you will find a way out much faster.;
I also advise you to come to my Army Store;
I sell tank upgrades there.;
You can also buy new tanks there, cooler;
It's in the Main Menu, if anything. You'll figure out the rest yourself. See you again!;
