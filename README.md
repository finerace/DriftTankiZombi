# Drift Tanks vs Zombies

A game about tanks crushing zombies was not my most successful project. The assets were used to the minimum, and I would like to single out PluginYG for its quick integration with the Yandex Games API.

In addition, due to the rushed nature of the project, the code is not of the highest quality and leaves much to be desired.
